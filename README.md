# LAN Network Design for 155-User Organization

## 📌 Project Overview
A complete LAN design proposal for a medium-sized organization with 155 users across 5 departments, featuring:
- Extended star topology
- VLAN segmentation
- DHCP implementation
- Firewall security
- OSPF routing
- Structured cabling (TIA-606-C standard)

## 🏗️ Network Structure
| Department       | Users | Key Requirements                      |
|------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| Sales            | 40    | Fast DB access, video conferencing    |
| Technical Support| 40    | Stable remote support connections     |
| Management       | 30    | Secure internal/external comms        |
| Development      | 25    | High-speed file transfers             |
| HR               | 20    | Cloud-based HR systems                |

## 🔧 Key Features
- **Performance:** QoS policies for critical apps
- **Security:** Firewall, VLANs, strong authentication
- **Reliability:** Redundant connections, UPS backup
- **Management:** Detailed monitoring system

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (simulation)
- OSPF routing protocol
- DHCP server
- Firewall with ACLs
- TIA-606-C cabling standard

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add redundant switches/routers
- Implement VPN and IDS/IPS
- Enhance monitoring (PRTG/Wireshark)
